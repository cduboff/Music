Music social site

A social site where users can create posts and share songs with others.
Upon registration users should create a bio inlcuding favorite genres, and a few fav songs

Features for MVP:
- reg: name, username, email, password, bio
- log: username, password
- main page (posts and comments. posts should contain song recs.)
- comments on posts and song recs
- suggest songs in posts, or to specific users
- spotify api integration (used to find songs, artists, and genres)
- page about a specific user (include name, and posts)
- ability to edit user info, posts, and comments
Project backlog:
- random song generator
- like posts and song recs
- like songs
- add post likes to the page about a specific user

(wireframe does not include all features, once I figure out how to integrate the Spotify API it will be easier to visualize)
